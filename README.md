# Student-performance-detection
# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict student academic performance based on various factors such as demographics, study habits, parental background, and extracurricular activities. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project helps in identifying students who may need additional support and provides insights for educators to improve academic outcomes.

📊 Project Workflow

Data Collection – Gather dataset from Kaggle/UCI.

Data Preprocessing – Clean data, handle null values, encode categorical features.

EDA – Understand dataset patterns with graphs & statistics.

Feature Engineering – Select important predictors.

Model Training – Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

Evaluation – Compare models and select the best one.

Prediction – Predict student performance for new data.
